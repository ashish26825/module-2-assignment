                <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many different ways to eat chicken. You can eat it grilled, roasted, with vegetable,
                     with rice, the list goes on and on, but my favorite way to eat chicken is fried. Fried chicken
                      is one of my favorite dishes to eat, especially when it comes with mashed potatoes and gravy.
                       Something about the crispiness of the chicken paired with the creaminess of the mashed potato 
                       that makes the two a perfect pair. Along with the meal, I would often drink some Coca Cola to
                        help my body wash down all the food that I had just consumed. This meal takes me back to my 
                        childhood, when I would eat it with my family. We would often get it on warm summer nights
                         when my family was too tired from work or the weather was to hot that it would be easier to
                          go get some take out.

                <p>
                        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have 
                        been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of high-quality protein and
                         nutrients.Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into 
                         certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak , while other cuts are processed.
                          Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner 
                           cattle, are ground, minced or used in
                            sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts
                             that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue,
                              tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands, the heart, the brain , the kidneys, and the tender
                               testicles of the bull. Some intestines arecooked and eaten as is, but are more
                                often cleaned and used as natural sausage  casings.

                <h2>Sushi</h2>
                <p>
                        Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice , usually with some sugar and salt, 
                        accompanying a variety of ingredients such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally 
                        tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key 
                        ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari  or sumeshi .Sushi is traditionally
                         made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain
                          rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna
                           or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled
                            ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular
                             garnishes for the dish.
